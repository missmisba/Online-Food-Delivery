        <p class="info">The only time to eat diet food is while you're waiting for the steak to cook.<br>
            Laughter is brightest where food is best.Life is a combination of magic and pasta.<br>
            food, substance consisting essentially of protein,carbohydrate,fat,and other nutrients used in the body of
            an organism to sustain growth and vital processes and <br>
            to furnish energy. The absorption and utilization of food by the body is fundamental to nutrition and is
            facilitated by digestion. <br>
            Plants, which convert solar energy to food by photosynthesis, are the primary food source.<br>
            animals that feed on plants often serve as sources of food for other animals.<br>
            To learn more about the sequence of transfers of matter and energy in the form of food from organism to
            organism, see food chain.<br>
            Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism.
            Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates,
            fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.
            Thus, all the dishes have different taste. Furthermore, our nature provides us a variety of food. From
            fruits to vegetables, from Dairy food to seafood everything is available. Different countries have their own
            specialty of dishes.
